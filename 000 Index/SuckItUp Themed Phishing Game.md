You play as a criminal hacker stealing peoples money but in order to do that you must convince them to send you the money. The game is themed around deception and hacker culture.

The game takes place on a desktop screen, where they can drag windows around and open certain apps (internet, terminal, exit game, options, etc). Your goal as the player is to go through your ~~victims~~ contact list and try to phish them for money.

The game mechanics are just general phishing tactics, such as looking them up on social media or pretending to be a loved one etc. We can have each contact in the list have a funny backstory or something

The main gimmick here just like suck it up is that you are attempting to trick a local LLM model. So some of the work to create real feeling/funny feeling characters will be with some system prompt engineering
